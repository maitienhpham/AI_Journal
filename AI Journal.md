Week01 AI Journal:

This week I had used AI to help me understand and better remember terms, and functions used within the exercise assignment better. I did not use AI for debugging. Some questions I had asked was how does the function max() work, and what branching meant in python.

Week02 AI Journal:

This week I had used AI the same way I did last week, by using it to help better explain terms and as well as give me examples of some terms. I believe I did not use it as much as I did compared to last weeks exercise however. I did not use AI for debugging. I ended up having to ask about how to use range(), asked for some examples of parsing and what it was, and as well as reminded myself what enumerate() did.

Week03 AI Journal:

I definitely ended up having to use AI a lot this week. I had a little trouble understanding some of the questions, so I relied on AI a bit heavily for some definitions and examples. However, since I use Google Cobalt for my exercises, the built in AI helped me a bunch. I am not sure how I activated it as it never popped up before, but examples of code would randomly appear for many of the questions. I do not remember for which ones, but it definitely helped me get through this week's assignments much better. I also used ChatGPT to further explain the examples given to me by Google Cobalt, but I am not sure if it is captured in the link I am putting here.

Week 04 AI Journal:

I unfortunately again ended up using AI more for this week's exercise, and did have to use it for some debugging. It was a bit hard at first as I needed a lot of practice to get back on remembering how to do these types of coding exercises, so AI definitely helped a lot with reminding me how.

Most of the AI help was actually from the AI built into Cobalt, however I am not actually sure of how I activated it or if it really is just built in. I do not know how to record what helped me, but I do remember that it helped me the most by explaining to me my errors, and helping me to fix them and debug.

I did also used ChatGPT but to help remind me, or to better explain certain topics, vocabulary, and the examples for the lecture. I also used it to help explain a few things that the AI had generated for me on Cobalt.

Week 05 AI Journal:

I also ended up having to use AI a lot more than I wanted to for this week's exercise as well. However, I used it more so to explain what the questions were asking me because I was getting a bit too confused from the wording. I did this for many of the questions as seen in my ChatGPT link below.

Another way I used AI was to explain an example provided within the lecture file provided in the Week 05 module. 

I did use AI a little bit to help debug small parts, and to explain why the specific part was changed.

Week 06 AI Journal:

This week, the exercises were more challenging to me than usual so I did end up having to use AI again to verify a few things for me. I tried restraining myself to only use it to either define words/topics for me, or to further explain what the question was trying to ask. I believe that I did ask AI to help debug one exercise for me (question 18). However, I ended up not using the code AI gave me as I still did not fully understand it.

I asked AI to help refresh my brain about class and static methods as it has been a bit since we have done exercises due to fall break, and as well as a lot on how to define and format date and times in code.

(Ignore one chat that I sent where I did not realize I had highlighted the whole exercise rather than one question)

Week 07 AI Journal:

For this week's exercise, I used AI to explain to me a few of the questions and as well as debug/explain some answers. It was a bit challenging for me, so I unfortunately used it more than I would have liked to. 

For example, I used AI to help me to better understand the starter helper so that I knew what I was working with. I used AI to help me debug and explain to me questions like question 14, where I was a bit confused as to what it was asking for and I did not know how to begin it. I tried using AI to help explain to me question 12, however even with the answer provided to me I did not understand a part of it, so I did not include it into my code.

I also used AI to provide me a refresher of UTF-8 text files.
