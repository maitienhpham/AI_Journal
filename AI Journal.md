Week01 AI Journal:

This week I had used AI to help me understand and better remember terms, and functions used within the exercise assignment better. I did not use AI for debugging. Some questions I had asked was how does the function max() work, and what branching meant in python.

Week02 AI Journal:

This week I had used AI the same way I did last week, by using it to help better explain terms and as well as give me examples of some terms. I believe I did not use it as much as I did compared to last weeks exercise however. I did not use AI for debugging. I ended up having to ask about how to use range(), asked for some examples of parsing and what it was, and as well as reminded myself what enumerate() did.

Week03 AI Journal:

I definitely ended up having to use AI a lot this week. I had a little trouble understanding some of the questions, so I relied on AI a bit heavily for some definitions and examples. However, since I use Google Cobalt for my exercises, the built in AI helped me a bunch. I am not sure how I activated it as it never popped up before, but examples of code would randomly appear for many of the questions. I do not remember for which ones, but it definitely helped me get through this week's assignments much better. I also used ChatGPT to further explain the examples given to me by Google Cobalt, but I am not sure if it is captured in the link I am putting here.

Week 04 AI Journal:

I unfortunately again ended up using AI more for this week's exercise, and did have to use it for some debugging. It was a bit hard at first as I needed a lot of practice to get back on remembering how to do these types of coding exercises, so AI definitely helped a lot with reminding me how.

Most of the AI help was actually from the AI built into Cobalt, however I am not actually sure of how I activated it or if it really is just built in. I do not know how to record what helped me, but I do remember that it helped me the most by explaining to me my errors, and helping me to fix them and debug.

I did also used ChatGPT but to help remind me, or to better explain certain topics, vocabulary, and the examples for the lecture. I also used it to help explain a few things that the AI had generated for me on Cobalt.

Week 05 AI Journal:

I also ended up having to use AI a lot more than I wanted to for this week's exercise as well. However, I used it more so to explain what the questions were asking me because I was getting a bit too confused from the wording. I did this for many of the questions as seen in my ChatGPT link below.

Another way I used AI was to explain an example provided within the lecture file provided in the Week 05 module. 

I did use AI a little bit to help debug small parts, and to explain why the specific part was changed.
