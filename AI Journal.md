Week01 AI Journal:

This week I had used AI to help me understand and better remember terms, and functions used within the exercise assignment better. I did not use AI for debugging. Some questions I had asked was how does the function max() work, and what branching meant in python.

Week02 AI Journal:

This week I had used AI the same way I did last week, by using it to help better explain terms and as well as give me examples of some terms. I believe I did not use it as much as I did compared to last weeks exercise however. I did not use AI for debugging. I ended up having to ask about how to use range(), asked for some examples of parsing and what it was, and as well as reminded myself what enumerate() did.
